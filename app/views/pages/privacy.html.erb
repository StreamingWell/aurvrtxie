		<p>We at Vertex are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal information of all visitors to this website. We are also committed to complying with all laws applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Please read this privacy policy – it governs our use of your personal information and, by submitting any such information, you are agreeing to its terms.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Privacy policy updates</strong></p>
		<p>Vertex reserves the right to change this policy at any time, based on the needs of our customers, our business or the evolution of our websites. Please check the date at the bottom of this page to see when the policy was last revised. Use of Vertex websites by our visitors will be subject to the current privacy policy.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Cookies - information we collect</strong></p>
		<p>First, we passively collect information that is automatically sent to us by your web browser. This information typically includes your domain name (the website name after the “@” in your e-mail address). It may also contain additional information. The amount of information sent depends on the settings you have on your web browser; please refer to your browser to learn what information it sends.</p>

		<p>Second, if you consent to our use of cookies, we may actively obtain website usage information about you by installing a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are computer-generated, unique identifiers. By providing each user a unique identifier, we can recognize repeat visitors and compile data on how our websites are used. In the event that you consent to our use of cookies, our cookies will generate only limited information (as described in this privacy policy).</p>
		
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>How we use information</strong></p>
		<p>We use the information we automatically receive from your web browser, and any information that may be generated by cookies, to see which pages you visit within our website. Vertex can then develop statistics that are helpful to understanding how our website is used, and how we can continue to improve it.</p>

		<p>Information obtained from you may be used to generate a welcome email or other communication, notify you of website updates or provide you with services or information in response to your interests or data that you have provided. We may also use your information in order to better understand your needs and how we can improve our website.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Sharing and disclosure</strong></p>
		<p>We may contract with third parties to maintain and host our websites. We may also partner with other service providers in order to provide fulfillment of information requests or other services. These companies may have access to personal information you submit to or is collected automatically at our website, and for the purposes of maintaining and hosting the website your personal information may be transferred to and processed outside of the European Economic Area, including to/in the USA and/or other countries or territories which may not have adequate data protection laws.</p>

		<p>We may also use any information you submit to investigate security breaches or cooperate with authorities pursuant to a legal or other matters where we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. We may also remove all the personally identifiable information and use the rest for historical, statistical or business planning purposes.</p>

		<p>We will not sell your information to any other company or organization. However, in the event of a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor who is bound by the terms and conditions of this policy.</p>
		
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Security</strong></p>
		<p>Vertex and its third party partners use physical and technical security measures to protect the information you submit at our websites from unauthorized use or access. These measures include limited access to our computer facilities. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Applicable law</strong></p>
		<p>These terms and conditions, website privacy policy and cookie policy and the relationship between you and Vertex in the context of using the website shall be governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.</p>
